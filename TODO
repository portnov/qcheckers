- replace kcheckers with qcheckers

- rewrite TODO file; some things may be outdated.

- do we need to save "free men placement" state?!

	+ move names/game type to info...
	+ is void myView::slotNextRound() obsolete?
	+ doMove() always redraws board - really needed?

	+ Setting comments in Paused Mode disabled. Why?

	! SHARE_PATH is hard coded in main.cc kcheckers.pro

info:	+ Provide a function that returns what color is on turn.


to Qt 4.0:
	+ XML for theme files?
	+ save: should not overwrite but add? maybe add an option.

	+ info: columns should be resized to content's size. not working for
	  taglist.


translate themes.

duplicate themes at the moment.

comments of moves are not set on both sides. allow each player to change his
own move comments?

+ MISC
	- Why not logging the time when a move is done? Easy to implement.
	- Place kcheckersrc in $HOME/.kcheckers?

+ CONTINUE ONLINE GAME.
	this is not yet implemented. although it is simple. kcheckers is
	ready for this - i am not. i still have to think about this. the
	server side should be able to open pdn file.

+ SERVER IP!
    show server's ip in the new game dialog. in normal case linux has more than
    one configured network interface (see ifconfig output). qt failes to
    resolv the "right" one.

+ NETWORK SPECTATOR MODE.
    I think this would be cool :) Do i?

+ RENAME to qcheckers?
    when reading "kcheckers" one might think the program depends on kdelibs what
    is not true. renaming it to "qcheckers" clarifies its dependency on qt.

+ ANIMATED MOVES.
    this need to be done not just for fun. as for me, i sometimes do not notice
    engine's moves. i just see that it's my turn. in such cases i have to look
    at the move's list and check the last move.

+ GUI.
    although i am quite happy with current gui. need better themes/pixmaps for
    big board size.

+ THEMES.
    - Warnings due to failures on loading themes are not i18n. qWarning is used
      to display these warnings. Erroneous themes are ignored.
    - I use a simple text file to provide translated theme names.

+ PDN.
    - The FEN tag is not parsed at all, at the moment.
    - Errors in PDN files are logged untranslated.
    - What to do on abort? Cancel everything?
    - When continuing the game one must be able to choose the size/color.
